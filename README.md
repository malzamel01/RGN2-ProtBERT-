# RGN2

This is the reference implementation of recurrent geometric network-2 (RGN2), described in the paper _Single-sequence protein structure prediction using a language model and deep learning_.


## Usage
The orgnal RGN2 colab had major issue that are fixed in this [RGN2(AminoBERT)2.0] (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qy3VMcw--D5IjyKbaPIgTv5ASNZwl1rW)

[RGN2 ProtBert Model] [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fcSQoLKBI4OipNEUME1sd7ar0FHXReUR#scrollTo=t6Md6cKiez3y]. Still being built.
